Settings file containing color schemes for Ubuntu and Powershell for the Windows Terminal [Version 10.0.18363.836]

With the new version of the Windows Terminal, Microsoft changed the default Powershell scheme to plain black.
My settings aim to bring the "Powershell Noble Blue" scheme back along with a scheme for "Ubuntu".
The settings also include settings which makes the terminal look stunning with a blurred transparent background.
Everything has been documented for ease of readablitiy.
